Heroku Java + Tomcat BuildPack
------------------------------
A simple modification to https://github.com/heroku/heroku-buildpack-java to download and include Tomcat 7 in a your build directory at /tomcat. You can then use the Maven Resources plugin to overwrite any files configuration files and launch the project as necessary.

I hope to have more examples to come soon.
